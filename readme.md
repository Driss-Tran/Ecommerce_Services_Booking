# Advantages and Disadvantages
## # Advantages
1. The requirements are so comprehensive that I know what I need to do. 

2. I have enough time to finish this
3. I have learned C# (Asp .Net MVC) at University. Therefore, I do not have many difficulties in syntax or structure of C#.

## # Disadvantages
1. I had some difficulties when I looked for the host to deploy this website. Although I found it, it would be free in 60 days. After that, my web would be died.

2. About the source code, I try my best to write clean, maintainable and well-structured code. However, I think some structures of codes are not really good enough. 

3. Because I usally make reports at University by docx, this is the first time I have written the **.md** file. 
## # Experienced Lessions 
1. I have a chance to learn how to write **.md** file basically and correctly.

2. I learnt that how to organize or write maintainable and well-structured code.
